up on the 47th of skyville, clutching a bottle of soju, teacher’s whiskey hitting like a slow burn. I flick my eyes to the heavens; 'picture it love, the galaxy’s a riot of glimmers and you’re this rogue flare, weaving through people’s stories. Here one minute, gone another. No one can keep you, but they’ll always watch from a distance, a little bit in love, a little bit in awe.'
